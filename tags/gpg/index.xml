While I had heard of GPG and used it slightly before, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that you could also use it in git to sign your commits in order to prove that you were the one to commit code.
The setup for my YubiKey took me about a day, as there was issue after issue with the YubiKey, so in this guide I hope to show a relatively painless and secure setup for the YubiKey.</description></item></channel></rss>
